## Installation

The code should run using Python versions 3.*.  
There is an aditional library beyond the Anaconda packages called gmaps.

## Project Motivation

This is my first project of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program.  
This project consists of choosing a public dataset to answer at least three questions related to business. To do that, it must prepare, analyze, model and visualize data.

I choose a Rio de Janeiro Airbnb dataset to answer the following questions:
1.	What is The TOP 10 most expensive neighbourhoods?
2.	What is the TOP 10 most listed neighbourhoods and which one is the most expensive?
3.	What is the Top 10 neighbourhoods with better review rating?
4.	How are the listings distributed throughout Rio de Janeiro?

The files can be found at inside airbnb website avaiable [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html). 

## File Descriptions

* Airbnb_Rio_de_Janeiro_neighbourhood_analysis.ipynb: notebook to showcase all the analyzes related to the above questions.
* listings.csv: dataset used in this analysis.

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://matheusbusch.medium.com/rio-de-janeiros-neighbourhoods-analysis-83e903065701).
